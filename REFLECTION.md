# Reflection: Challenges in Balancing Stakeholder Needs

## 1. Conflicting Priorities
One of the main challenges was balancing the needs of different stakeholders. For example, employees want an easy-to-use self-service portal, while IT administrators prioritize security. Ensuring both usability and strong access controls required compromises.

## 2. Compliance vs. Efficiency
The Compliance Officer's demand for strict tax calculation and reporting sometimes conflicted with the Finance Officer’s need for quick payroll processing. Ensuring accuracy without slowing down performance was a key concern.

## 3. Security vs. Accessibility
The IT Administrator wanted strict role-based access, which could limit HR and Finance’s ability to work efficiently. To balance this, we designed a flexible permission system that allows limited but secure data access.

## 4. System Performance Under Load
Scalability was another issue. The CEO wanted the system to handle thousands of employees, but the IT team was concerned about server load. To resolve this, we optimized queries and considered cloud deployment for scalability.

## 5. Cost Considerations
The CEO focused on reducing payroll costs, but implementing a secure and feature-rich system required investments in encryption and cloud services. A phased approach to implementation helped manage costs.

## 6. User Experience Challenges
HR managers needed a detailed payroll interface, while employees wanted a simple, mobile-friendly dashboard. A dual-interface approach was designed to meet both needs.
