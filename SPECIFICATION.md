# System Specification - Automated Payroll System

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction
**Project Title:** Automated Payroll System  
**Domain:** Human Resources & Finance  

### Problem Statement  
Manual payroll processing is error-prone, time-consuming, and difficult to scale. Companies often struggle with accurate salary calculations, tax deductions, and compliance with financial regulations. The **Automated Payroll System** will streamline payroll management, ensuring accurate computations, payslip generation, and seamless salary disbursement through bank integrations.

### Individual Scope (Feasibility Justification)
The system is **feasible and scalable** due to:
- The **availability of open-source technologies** (Node.js, PostgreSQL, React).
- **Cost-effectiveness** since cloud-based deployment reduces infrastructure costs.
- **Scalability** for companies of various sizes with different payroll structures.
- **Security & Compliance** through encryption and role-based access.
