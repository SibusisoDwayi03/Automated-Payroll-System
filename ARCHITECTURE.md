# Automated Payroll System - Architecture

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Overview

### **Project Title**: Automated Payroll System  
### **Domain**: Human Resources & Payroll Management

The **Automated Payroll System** is designed to streamline and automate the payroll processing tasks for businesses. It enables employees to view their payslips, HR and finance departments to manage payroll efficiently, and ensures automatic salary payments via bank integration.

### **Problem Statement**:  
Manual payroll processes are often time-consuming, error-prone, and complex, especially in organizations with large numbers of employees. The Automated Payroll System aims to address these issues by automating payroll calculations, tax deductions, generating payslips, and processing salary payments seamlessly.

### **Individual Scope**:  
The project is feasible as it leverages modern web technologies (React.js, Node.js), a relational database (PostgreSQL), and email/notification systems (NodeMailer). The system will allow businesses to automate payroll tasks, reducing errors and administrative workload.
