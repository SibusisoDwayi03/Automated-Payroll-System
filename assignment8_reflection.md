Challenges:

Striking a balance between detail and readability in diagrams proved challenging. Overly detailed diagrams became visually complex and difficult to interpret.

Identifying the appropriate states and transitions without introducing redundancy required several iterative refinements.

Ensuring full traceability between each user story or functional requirement and the corresponding model involved meticulous cross-referencing and validation.

### Diagram Comparison

| Feature           | State Diagrams                        | Activity Diagrams                   |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Focus**        | Captures the lifecycle of a system object over time | Shows the sequential flow of activities or tasks |
| **Used For**     | Modeling object states and transitions (e.g., User Account, Payslip) | Representing workflows and processes (e.g., Payroll Processing) |
| **Stakeholders** | Developers, architects                 | End-users, testers, business analysts |
| **Granularity**  | Fine-grained (object-level)            | Medium to high-level (process-oriented) |
| **Visual Style** | Nodes (states) with directional transitions | Linear or branching task sequences |
| **Tools Used**
