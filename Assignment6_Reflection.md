# Reflection: Challenges in Agile Prioritization and Sprint Planning

## 1. Balancing Prioritization of Features
A key challenge was deciding which features should be prioritized in the backlog. While core payroll functions like payslip viewing and payroll processing were obvious **Must-haves**, determining whether tax calculations and approval workflows should be included in the initial sprint was more difficult. MoSCoW prioritization helped break this down logically.

## 2. Estimating Effort for User Stories
Assigning story points to user stories was another difficulty. Features like **"HR processes payroll"** were complex and needed more time, while **"View payslip"** was relatively simple. Using the Fibonacci sequence helped balance large and small tasks.

## 3. Defining a Realistic Sprint Scope
Planning a 2-week sprint required careful selection of user stories. Initially, we considered implementing all backlog features, but this was unrealistic. Breaking down large user stories into smaller tasks helped define a more achievable sprint backlog.

## 4. Managing Dependencies Between Stories
Some stories depended on others. For example, **"HR approves payroll"** depended on **"Payroll processing"** being completed first. Identifying these dependencies ensured that sprint tasks were properly sequenced.

## 5. Aligning Agile with Stakeholder Needs
Since I was the only stakeholder at this stage, I had to evaluate my own conflicting priorities. A focus on security (e.g., **AES-256 encryption**) versus usability (e.g., **Payslip viewing**) created trade-offs. To resolve this, I ensured that essential security features were included while still making the system functional.

## Conclusion
Sprint planning required making trade-offs between feature completeness, complexity, and sprint duration. By focusing on **MVP delivery**, breaking down tasks efficiently, and using Agile principles, we were able to define a realistic sprint that moves the project forward effectively.
