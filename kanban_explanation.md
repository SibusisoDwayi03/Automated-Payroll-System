# 📌 Kanban: Definition & Purpose

## **🔍 Definition**
Kanban is a **visual workflow management system** used to optimize and efficiently track tasks or processes. It is commonly applied in Agile methodologies to enhance transparency, reduce bottlenecks, and improve productivity.

## **🎯 Purpose of Kanban**
The primary goal of Kanban is to provide a **clear and real-time overview of work progress** by breaking tasks into stages. This approach allows teams to:

1. **Enhance Workflow Visibility** – Tasks are represented visually in different columns (e.g., Backlog, In Progress, Testing, Done), making it easier to track progress.
2. **Limit Work in Progress (WIP)** – Helps prevent task overload by enforcing work-in-progress limits.
3. **Improve Efficiency** – Enables continuous delivery by allowing work to flow smoothly without interruptions.
4. **Foster Collaboration** – Encourages team members to communicate and address blockers efficiently.
5. **Adapt to Changes Quickly** – Allows flexibility in prioritizing and managing tasks as project requirements evolve.

## **🔗 Kanban in Agile Development**
In Agile development, Kanban plays a crucial role in **iterative and incremental project management**, helping teams focus on delivering value continuously while maintaining adaptability.
